A brief description on data formats that you might encounter.

JSON
XML
File
These are often two kinds, some kind of a image or other format that you don't need to process, and a file that is basically a text file with a different file type. These are most often structured in a very specific way.

Note that CSV files are a little bit different in American and European format. Due to it's full name of Comma Separated Values the values are separated in America with a comma ',' and in Europe with a semicolon ';'. I'm from the Europe side and thus my examples will use the Europan format, if you need the American format just squint a little and ignore the semicolon dot and it should work fine.
